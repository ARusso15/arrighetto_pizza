    <h1>Arrighetto's pizzeria</h1>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> The Arrighetto family traveled to America in 1846. Through tough trials and strong backs they established themselves on the East Coast in the wonderful state of New Jersey. Their initial berth into the West was full of ups and downs. Finally in 1955 Alfonzo Arrighetto grew tired of the family methods of hard labor and decided to venture into the wonderful world of fine dining.In 1956 Alfonzo and his three sons Mario, Vinny, and Frankie broke ground on the construction of Arrighetto Pizza. Less than a year later the ovens were hot, and the pizzas flew from the doors faster that the family could make them. Business has, since that day, been astoundingly successful and will continue to for some time. Please stop and visit us today!</p>
