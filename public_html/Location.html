    <h1>Arrighetto's pizzeria</h1>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Located in the sceneic vista of the southern New Jersey, Arrighetto Pizza has proudly served the community since 1957. Arrighetto offers a unique location directly off the turnpike next to Salmone's Salon on 68th and Reiman Place. The Arrighetto family built their tiny pizza parlor in 1956. Just a father and his three sons, boldly chosing a central location in the middle of a developing area. We carry that boldness through our customer service and quality italian quisine.</p>
